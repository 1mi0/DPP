# Example Programs

The best way to experiment with these example programs is to delete the content from `test.cpp` in the library repository, and replace it with program code as shown below. You can then use `cmake` and `make` to build the bot without having to mess around with installation, dependencies etc.

## Creating a simple program to reply to a message

In this example we will create a C++ version of the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) example program.

The two programs can be seen side by side below:

| C++/DPP               | JavaScript/Discord.js      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|

Let's break this program down step by step:

### 1. Start with an empty C++ program

Make sure to include the header file for the D++ library with the instruction `#include <dpp/dpp.h>`!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 2. Create an instance of dpp::cluster

To make use of the library you must create a dpp::cluster object. This object is the main object in your program like the `Discord.Client` object in Discord.js.

You can instantiate this class as shown below. Remember to put your bot token in the code where it says `"token"`!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    dpp::cluster bot("token");

    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 3. Attach to an event

To have a bot that does something, you should attach to some events. Let's start by attaching to the `on_ready` event (dpp::cluster::on_ready) which will notify your program when the bot is connected:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    dpp::cluster bot("token");

    bot.on_ready([&bot](const dpp::ready_t & event) {
    });

    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 4. Attach to another event to reveice messages

If you want to receive messages, you should also attach your program to the `on_message_create` event (dpp::cluster::on_message_create) which is the same as the Discord.js `message` event. You add this to your program after the `on_ready` event:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    dpp::cluster bot("token");

    bot.on_ready([&bot](const dpp::ready_t & event) {
    });

    bot.on_message_create([&bot](const dpp::message_create_t & event) {
    });

    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 5 . Add some content to the events

Attaching to an event is a good start, but to make a bot you should actually put some program code into the events. Lets add some simple things into the events. We will add some code to the `on_ready` event to output the bot's nickname (dpp::cluster::me) and some code into the `on_message_create` to look for messages that are the text `!ping` and reply with `!pong`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    dpp::cluster bot("token");

    bot.on_ready([&bot](const dpp::ready_t & event) {
        std::cout << "Logged in as " << bot.me.username << "!\n";
    });

    bot.on_message_create([&bot](const dpp::message_create_t & event) {
        if (event.msg->content == "!ping") {
            bot.message_create(dpp::message(event.msg->channel_id, "Pong!"));
        }
    });

    bot.start(false);
    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's break down the code in the `on_message_create` event so that we can discuss what it is doing:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
if (event.msg->content == "!ping") {
	bot.message_create(dpp::message(event.msg->channel_id, "Pong!"));
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code is simply comparing the message content `event.msg->content` (dpp::message_create_t::content) against the value in a constant string value `"!ping"`. If they match, then the `message_create` function is called.

The `message_create` function (dpp::cluster::message_create) sends a message. There are many ways to call this function to send embed messages, upload files, and more, but for this simple demonstration we will just send some message text. The `message_create` function accepts a `dpp::message` object, which we create using two parameters:

* The channel ID to send to, which we get from `event.msg->channel_id` (dpp::message_create_t::channel_id)
* The message content, which for this demonstration we just make the static text `"Pong!"`.

### 6. Add code to start the bot!

To make the bot start, we must call the cluster::start method, e.g. in our program by using `bot.start(false)`.

The parameter which we set to false indicates if the function should return once all shards are created. Passing `false` here tells the program you do not need to do anything once `bot.start` is called, so the `return` statement directly afterwards is never reached:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    dpp::cluster bot("token");

    bot.on_ready([&bot](const dpp::ready_t & event) {
        std::cout << "Logged in as " << bot.me.username << "!\n";
    });

    bot.on_message_create([&bot](const dpp::message_create_t & event) {
        if (event.msg->content == "!ping") {
            bot.message_create(dpp::message(event.msg->channel_id, "Pong!"));
        }
    });

    bot.start(false);
    return 0;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### 7. Run your bot

Compile your bot using `cmake ..` and `make` from the build directory, and run it with `./test` - Congratulations, you now have a working bot written using the D++ library!
